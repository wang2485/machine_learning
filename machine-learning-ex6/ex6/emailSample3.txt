Hi all,
Building on the success of our widely acclaimed first Deep Learning Workshop,
we are going to try to do this again.

Please put the following times/dates on your calendar:
August 8, 1:00pm to 5:00pm
August 9, 1:00pm to 5:00pm


We were thinking that this time we might expect participants to have access to:
For the first days content: An ITaP CPU cluster (i.e., Rice, Brown, or Snyder)
  For the second days content: An ITaP GPU cluster (i.e., BrownGPU or HalsteadGPU) 

Then the topics we might cover could be:
1) Basic feedforward CNN architectures
a) ResNet
b) U-net
2) Recurrent NNs
3) GPU TensorFlow
4) GANs

Please provide feedback on our suggestions above.
Also, if YOU want to help, or if you have STUDENTS or POSTDOCS that want to help, then WE NEED HELP!

Thanks
Charlie
